##### Spring Centered:

* [Introducing JSON-B with Spring Boot 2.0](https://www.e4developer.com/2018/03/04/introducing-json-b-with-spring-boot-2-0/) - no harm to know there is another choice besides Jackson

* [Introduction to Concurrency in Spring Boot](https://www.e4developer.com/2018/03/30/introduction-to-concurrency-in-spring-boot/) - default Tomcat thread is 200... 

##### Java Centered:

* [Randoop](https://randoop.github.io/randoop/) - Automatic unit test generation for Java. Only if you simply just want coverage for tons of Java classes which I normally just start from something small first.

* [Tablesaw](https://github.com/jtablesaw/tablesaw) -  is a Java dataframe similar to Pandas in Python. That is why I notice it.

##### Javascript Stuffs:

* [Replacing jQuery With Vue.js: No Build Step Necessary](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/02/jquery-vue-javascript/) - I am torn between Reactjs and Vue so I keep resources for both ...

* [Machine Learning in Javascript](https://bri.im/) - wow ...

* [](https://github.com/n0ruSh/the-art-of-reading) - repo contains a list of reading notes for the books that [n0ruSh](https://github.com/n0ruSh) have read and personally think worth sharing. It's mostly on Javascript.

##### Others

* [Robin's Work with Me](https://www.robinwieruch.de/work-with-me/) - I like the presentation although I don't know what I can work with him.

* [How to write a great developer résumé and showcase your software engineer skills?](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-write-a-great-resume-for-software-engineers-75d514dd8322) - great tips in here

* [8 Bulk Update Methods Compared](http://www.orafaq.com/node/2450) - quite a good summary on the possible ways of doing UPDATES in ORACLE. If you are brainstorming about UPDATES, this might just be what you need.
