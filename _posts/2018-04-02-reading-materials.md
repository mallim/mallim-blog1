Here are some reading materials which I keep here to browse through when I am in a MRT or long trip.

### Reading Materials related to Streams or equivalent

* [Refactoring with Loops and Collection Pipelines](https://martinfowler.com/articles/refactoring-pipelines.html) - looks interesting that I felt the need to go through a few more times 
* [Common SQL Clauses and Their Equivalents in Java 8 Streams](https://blog.jooq.org/2015/08/13/common-sql-clauses-and-their-equivalents-in-java-8-streams/)

### Reading Materials related to Technical Teams

* [Agile For Teams](https://leanpub.com/agileforteams/read#leanpub-auto-vision)
