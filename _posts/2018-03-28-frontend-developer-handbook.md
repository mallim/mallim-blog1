I spotted this on 2015 where the handbook is actually known as [Front-End Developer Handbook 2016](https://frontendmasters.gitbooks.io/front-end-handbook/content/index.html). 
And now it is updated to [Front-End Developer Handbook 2017](https://frontendmasters.com/books/front-end-handbook/2017/). Wow
