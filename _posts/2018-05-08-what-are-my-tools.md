Tools and utilities which I will install when I got a new laptop for development besides my usual IDE.

## The Must-Haves

### [FreeCommander](https://freecommander.com)

[FreeCommander](https://freecommander.com) is the Windows Explorer replacement which I will always install.<br> 
Besides the dual pane, the file search is one of the best and accurate which I come across. Sometimes, with 
[FreeCommander](https://freecommander.com) and [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), I can just go on
to edit Java source code.

### [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)

[Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) is the Windows Notepad replacement with the necessary color syntax required to see a lot of different types of file formats.
I seldom open Windows Notepad because of [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). Portable version available.

### [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/)

[7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) is my default tool for opening zip and tar.gz files. Portable version available.

### [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/)

[ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/) is the multi-tab Windows console replacement. 
Most of the time, I will use Maven to compile source code, this comes in very handy with the colors and maximized Windows.
Portable version available.

### [IranView](https://www.irfanview.com/)

[IranView](https://www.irfanview.com/) is used for screenshots and cropping and quick way to edit images.

## The Second Waves

### [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/)

[reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) is my quick and dirty way to do technical presentation. I used the [reveal-md, reveal.js on steroids!](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md)
to have a better experience in using [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/).

### [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/)

[TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/) is my really really private personal wiki. Which to confess, I won't use at home :-) 

### [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)

[Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) this is must-have for REST API development.

## Team Must-Haves

### [Gitbucket](https://gitbucket.github.io/)

I used to use [Redmine](https://www.redmine.org/) as the go-to for intranet wiki, issues management alternative. Even since
I lay my hands on [Gitbucket](https://gitbucket.github.io/), it becomes my platform for intranet wiki and issues management alternative.
The only thing it is not good enough is actually the CI functionality.

### [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/)

[Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) is the default Continuous Integration tool I will use.

### [Nexus Repository OSS](https://www.sonatype.com/nexus-repository-oss)

[Nexus Repository OSS](https://www.sonatype.com/nexus-repository-oss) is the private maven repository manage. 
Alternatively, I am going to explore using Git as the private maven repository.

## In the pipeline to try out...

I will always keep a look out of the different handy tools to use for development purpose:

* [Lepton](https://github.com/hackjutsu/Lepton) - github snippet management
* [The Silver Searcher](https://geoff.greer.fm/ag/) or [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) - code searching tool
* Exploring some Chrome Extensions from https://medium.freecodecamp.org/tools-i-wish-i-had-known-about-when-i-started-coding-57849efd9248, 
ColorZilla, CSS Peeper, Pesticide.

## Inspired by

* [Tools I wish I had known about when I started coding](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/tools-i-wish-i-had-known-about-when-i-started-coding-57849efd9248)
* [Keep calm and code on: Productivity tools for developers](https://dev.to/marina_pilip/keep-calm-and-code-on-productivity-tools-for-developers-10o4)


Let me know if you think there are tools which I should explore...
