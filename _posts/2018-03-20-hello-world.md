Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. 

<!--more-->

### Treat this as Hello World

Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. 
It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

### Acknowledgements

This site is made possible by the amazing people in the internet, special thanks to :

* [Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) for the inspiration
* [John Smith's The Friday theme](https://sfreytag.github.io/friday-theme/index.html) for the theme

## Disqus is a challenging story

Disqus website itself too generic to be helpful.

* Inspired by [Setup up a jekyll blog using github pages and disqus comments](http://vdaubry.github.io/2014/10/19/setup-a-jekyll-blog/)
* Done by using the instructions here [Disqus comments setup for Jekyll](https://desiredpersona.com/disqus-comments-jekyll/)

### What's next?
