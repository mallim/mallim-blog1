Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. 

<!--more-->

### Treat this as Hello World 

But is actually like a changelog

Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. 
It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

## Update 24-Mar: Added Webanalytics for Jekyll

* Refer to [Jekyll::analytics](https://github.com/hendrikschneider/jekyll-analytics) 
* [Adding Google Analytics to Jekyll](https://groundberry.github.io/setup/2016/09/16/adding-google-analytics-to-jekyll.html) - a short tutorial on Jekyll with Google Analytics 
* [Google Search Console](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home) - added site to Google Search Console

### Update before 24-Mar: Disqus is a challenging story

Disqus website itself too generic to be helpful.

* Inspired by [Setup up a jekyll blog using github pages and disqus comments](http://vdaubry.github.io/2014/10/19/setup-a-jekyll-blog/)
* Done by using the instructions here [Disqus comments setup for Jekyll](https://desiredpersona.com/disqus-comments-jekyll/)
