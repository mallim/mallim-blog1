Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. 

<!--more-->

### Treat this as Hello World 

But is actually like a changelog

Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. 
It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

### Version

This is updated to this point - [Tidied up tag opening/closing and interaction with URL, which Fixes #6](https://github.com/sfreytag/friday-theme/commit/c599819c1fa40cb0a3145c62aeb94f8015054d5d)

## Update 24-Mar: Added Webanalytics for Jekyll, Sitemap

* This one does not automatically generate the Google Analytics script - [Jekyll::analytics](https://github.com/hendrikschneider/jekyll-analytics). Instead followed the instructions in here - 
[Google Analytics for Jekyll](https://desiredpersona.com/google-analytics-jekyll/)
* [Google Search Console](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home) - added site to Google Search Console
* [Generate Jekyll XML Sitemap Manually Without Using Plugin](https://www.goyllo.com/jekyll-xml-sitemap/) - followed instruction here to add sitemap.xml 

### Update before 24-Mar: Disqus is a challenging story

Disqus website itself too generic to be helpful.

* Inspired by [Setup up a jekyll blog using github pages and disqus comments](http://vdaubry.github.io/2014/10/19/setup-a-jekyll-blog/)
* Done by using the instructions here [Disqus comments setup for Jekyll](https://desiredpersona.com/disqus-comments-jekyll/)
