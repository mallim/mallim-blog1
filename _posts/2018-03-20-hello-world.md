Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. 

<!--more-->

### Treat this as Hello World 

But is actually like a changelog

Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. 
It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.
